# Self-driving-Car
# Car Racing Game with NEAT

This project is a car racing game implemented using the Pygame library and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm for training neural networks.

## Game Description

The game features a car that can be controlled by neural networks trained using the NEAT algorithm. The objective of the game is to navigate the car around a track without colliding with any obstacles. The car can move forward, turn left, or turn right. The neural networks control the car's movements based on input from radar sensors that detect obstacles in the environment.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- NEAT library

## Installation and Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
3.pip install pygame neat
4.Clone or download the project files.
5.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
6.Run the game by executing the following command:
  python car_racing_game.py

7.The game window will open, and you can control the car using the neural networks trained by the NEAT algorithm.
